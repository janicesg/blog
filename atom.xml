    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Recently I had 1-on-1 catch ups with my manager and mentors, here are some thoughts worth noting down for my record.  </p><h2 id="Influence-and-Persuasion"><a href="#Influence-and-Persuasion" class="headerlink" title="Influence and Persuasion"></a>Influence and Persuasion</h2><p>To build one’s influence successfully means your bosses and peers buy in your ideas at critical decision points. I have observed that some people step back when decisions need to make, but once decisions are made, they groan that the decision is poor, and he is not happy with it. Hypothetically, Let’s assume a scenario where several proposals are for the boss to pick. If he chooses one proposal touted by someone who is very good at persuasion, although it is the worst proposal in your opinion, you still have to bear with the consequences of decision made. Because you don’t try to step in. </p><p>Therefore, lean in when with a valid perspective, but try to integrate presentation, persuasion, selling, and negotiation skills to convince others. Gradually, the positive image and branding will build up. These skills are not acquired instantly, but with this mindset in head, it should gradually improve over time with consistent practice. </p><h2 id="Ask-WHY-then-WHAT"><a href="#Ask-WHY-then-WHAT" class="headerlink" title="Ask WHY, then WHAT"></a>Ask WHY, then WHAT</h2><p>I know the WHY and WHAT are already cliche, but just want to add some takeaways based on my personal experience. For example, because I work in a big team, and it is common for manager to split workloads among team members. when I was assigned with a jira, normally it is to develop a feature in one service, recently I tend to limit myself to assigned work, without wanting to learn about what others are doing. But the key to grow and be able to take on bigger responsibility in a team lies in your capability to understand the domain knowledge and business flows end to end. Limiting yourself to a narrow spotlight will prohibit learning and understanding the big picture, and detrimental to personal growth.</p><p>Therefore,</p><ul><li>When assigned with tasks, always actively ask why it has to be done in certain way, approach stakeholders to understand it from multiple perspectives, including Business Analyst(BA), Program Manager, Client. Dive into details on WHAT, WHEN and HOW, to learn about the decisions made, and have an opinion to give feedback on those decisions. </li><li>Secondly, talk with teammates to understand what they are working on to learn about the whole picture.</li><li>Thirdly, when making product fix, don’t assume the existing code will work with your fix perfectly well, even though you fix is one line of code. Always carefully scrutinize the code and check with BA on the expected behavior. </li></ul><h2 id="Make-yourself-visible"><a href="#Make-yourself-visible" class="headerlink" title="Make yourself visible"></a>Make yourself visible</h2><p>Visibility impacts your future opportunities, put it in a blunt but simple way. In a department with 100+ employees, become the go-to person of others by helping them and actively participating in events. Grab the opportunity to present your expertise to others, and let them especially management teams recognize your potential. </p><p>Let’s Reflect, summarize, and grow together :)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>I went to Switzerland on a two-week’s personal trip with my friend CM in the spring of 2018. Switzerland, is like a ‘Jungfrau’, who impressed me, a visitor from afar, with the breath-taking view and hospitable people. I was trying to be a vegetarian back then, so CM and I only had one meal with her old school friend in a local restaurant. We cooked and packed our meals for the rest of the trip, which is why there won’t be a lot of typical exotic food pictures below.<br>We planned to tour the whole country within 15 days, so we rent an airbnb studio in Basel, a small town located in the middle of Switzerland, and is accessible to all the tourist attractions via trains. Yet due to the fact that most of the tourist attractions are scattered around the country, and are 2~3 hrs away from our airbnb, we had to get up at 4:30am and leave the house at 5:30am to catch the earliest train, so that we wouldn’t behind our schedule. So the trip was actually quite tiring, not mentioning the wake up hours, we did a lot of hiking too.<br>CM is a great planner, and she managed to plan for most the day trips. She even wrote down the timings of each trains that we should take, and in case of missing any, she wrote down the previous and next train timing as well.</p><h2 id="Lugano"><a href="#Lugano" class="headerlink" title="Lugano"></a>Lugano</h2><p>We went to Lugano, the capital of the southest Cantone Ticino bordered with Italy via train, and it took about 3hrs from where we stay.<br><img src="/switzerland-2018/lugano.jpg" width="720px"><br>The train station was high in the mountain, and we need to walk down the hill to the city.<br><img src="/switzerland-2018/luganoBell.jpg" width="720px"><br>Before we boarded for our boat trip, we bumped into an open area event happening at the market center. There were performances of kids, including ballet, kpop dancing, and a children orchestra performance.<br><img src="/switzerland-2018/dance.jpg" width="720px"><br>We took a boat to tour around the lake bordering with Italy, and the flag is even italian.<br><img src="/switzerland-2018/italianflag.jpg" width="720px"><br>The boat trip lasted about 4hrs, our original plan was to visit the village across, however there was no time, thus we decided to walk around lugano for a while.</p><p>The Gelato is pretty authentic, they even offered Vegan flavor for CM. I got an vanilla flavor, and I had to admit it melts very fast in the middle of the hot early summer day.<br><img src="/switzerland-2018/gelato_1.jpg" width="720px"></p><p>To be continued……</p>]]></content>
