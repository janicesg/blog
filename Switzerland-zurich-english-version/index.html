        <h3 id="Preface"><a href="#Preface" class="headerlink" title="Preface"></a>Preface</h3><p>I took a two-week personal trip with my friend CM in May 2018. The natural scenery in Switzerland left a deep impression on me, and the breathtaking scenery became my most beautiful memory in 2018. At that time I was thinking about being a vegetarian, so CM and I only had a meal with her old classmates in a local restaurant. In the following journey, most of the time we cooked the food in advance, packed the food in a sealed lunch box, and ate it on the return train, so this travelogue does not have many typical exotic food photos.</p>
<p>We plan to visit the entire country in 15 days, so we rented an airbnb studio in Basel, a small town in central Switzerland, from where you can take a train to all tourist attractions. But since most tourist attractions are scattered all over the country and about 2 to 3 hours away from our Airbnb, we have to get up at 4:30am and leave the house at 5:30am in order to catch the earliest train, so we Will not fall behind the schedule. Therefore, this trip is actually very tiring. Another reason, of course, is that we did a lot of hiking.</p>
<p>CM is an excellent planner, she made plans for most day trips. The itinerary is divided into days, so that it can be adjusted in time according to weather changes. She is a super-experienced trip planner, and even wrote down the time of every train we should take, and in case of missing any time, she also wrote down the time of the previous and next train. So the entire trip is full of schedules, and there is no missed train or even a temporary change of plan.</p>
<p>This travelogue will mainly share the travel experience and some beautiful photos taken with me. The epidemic is trapped at home now. Recalling the situation at that time is also a cloud travel. This also fully proves that I am a procrastinating patient in organizing travel notes, severely.</p>
<h3 id="1-Departure"><a href="#1-Departure" class="headerlink" title="1. Departure"></a>1. Departure</h3><p>Our ticket is from Singapore to Doha, Qatar, the terminal Zurich, about ten hours.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_050901.jpg?token=ADYYPSXDJECH2G5WSASBLF27BMGXU" alt=""><br>When I stopped at Doha International Airport, there was a huge bear, and I didn’t know what mascot it was, so I just took a picture of it.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_010126.jpg?token=ADYYPSRMH3EIS4UW4PMT35K7BMGX6" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="2-Arrival-in-Zurich"><a href="#2-Arrival-in-Zurich" class="headerlink" title="2. Arrival in Zurich"></a>2. Arrival in Zurich</h3><p>When our plane landed at Zurich Airport at about 6 in the morning, although the two of us slept all the way, we were still very excited when we arrived, and immediately woke up. Before getting off the plane, I put on a light make up. Light make-up, otherwise I looked tired and bored. After getting off the plane, there are many people in the customs, but unfortunately we don’t have the EU fast track to go. After passing the customs, we took the luggage and took the subway to the central train station.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_094750.jpg?token=ADYYPSX2AQA2NYSBPJ7TTWK7BMGW4" alt=""><br>Swiss subways and trains are quite similar, and there are newspapers left by passengers on the seats. Because Zurich is in the German-speaking area, the newspapers are also in German. However, I couldn’t understand it at the time. Although I can only know a few words now, which one The German God can translate what is said.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_083413.jpg?token=ADYYPSQA6ISTOPILC4M5F3S7BMGS6" alt=""><br>When we arrived at the central train station, we went to help CM to buy snow boots, but the results were obtained too early, and the store did not open the door. I had to drag the big box and walk back to the train station. This is the Zurich Central Station.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_113415.jpg" alt=""><br>When we were struggling to find a locker, CM had the courage to ask a stranger who sold fruits. He was very nice. Not only did he take us to find a place to get small changes, but he also took us to find the locker and help us lift it. Put the box in the locker, and finally took us around the station and left contact information with each other. The day after that, we were lucky to travel with him in Zurich together again.  Until now, we still follow each other on Instagram.<br>Things are set, the two of us go to the first attraction, Uetliberg.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_095627.jpg?token=ADYYPSX42HAXXAMRNRUKVMK7BMGXE" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a mountain near Zurich, about 870 meters high, but you can take the train to Uetliberg station and you can start hiking. It’s a pity that we went early that day, and there was light rain before, so the smog is a bit like being in a fairyland.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_101857.jpg?token=ADYYPSTRZRV32SSR32OVTOS7BMGWW" alt=""><br>Going down from the mountain, the two of us took the boat to ETH, the best university in Switzerland. Along the way, we sat beside the window seat and took a look at the view of Zurich along the lake.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_133437.jpg?token=ADYYPSTI3CRWJZKP2FDWTTS7BMGWQ" alt=""><br>Interestingly, each pier has a specially designed flag. I don’t know if it’s a pier flag. The Swiss really like flags,  and they have many interesting flag designs. There are many boats moored on the shore, and a few are driving. I have to admit that Zurich’s people are really comfortable living by the mountains and rivers, but the cost of living is really expensive. Sure enough, the mountains, waters, and coziness are almost as good as the Swiss franc.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_124746.jpg?token=ADYYPSTTTIUTE5RDJQA5WSK7BMGUU" alt=""><br>CM’s university exchange friends are studying for a Ph.D. in ETH. They agreed to meet in advance today, so we agreed to meet in ETH’s main square. The sun was warm at the time, many students were chatting on the square, and there were also drinks. When the two of us were waiting for our friends, we also bought a drink for ourselves.<br>This is a building of ETH. At that time, there was a group of students who followed the teacher to visit outside, perhaps to talk about history or architecture.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_135527.jpg" alt=""><br>ETH is on a hill, so from its square, the whole city has a panoramic view.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_140242.jpg?token=ADYYPSRYIOFWPKKJ6XVC3O27BMG3O" alt=""><br>The meeting between the French university and the professor was delayed, and I and CM decided to go around in the university. This is a university shop.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_150847.jpg?token=ADYYPSV6D5G36ZC7D4OAHBK7BMGUE" alt=""><br>Picture was taken in a corner where the sun can’t shine directly into my eyes.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_153524.jpg?token=ADYYPSXQEDUBQB5E5RKBUWK7BMGT6" alt=""></p>
<p>CM suggested that we take the small mountain train. I was shocked by the Swiss railway technology for the first time, although I was always shocked during this journey. The small train only takes a few minutes one way, and the two of us sat back and forth four times, like a kid who has never seen the world with a big heart. The next one is looking up, and the other is looking down. The little train is really fun to climb.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_150143.jpg?token=ADYYPSXGQH7PEQBDLTDCT5K7BMGU4" alt=""><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/up.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally waiting for the French university bully, we decided to take a walk in the old town. The old town is all stone roads, and the streets are lined with elegantly decorated old shops.<br>After passing a bridge, the weather was amazing.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_162456.jpg?token=ADYYPSURVUYPY2N7W2CMXHK7BMG3I" alt=""><br>Notice the double-roofed church on the right side of the picture above. We bought a ticket and climbed all the way up. The staircase is a narrow wooden spiral staircase, which is breathless to climb, but the scenery above is really good.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/20180518_155322.jpg?token=ADYYPSUAX56PLPMD3GVHM7C7BMG24" alt=""><br>It was about four o’clock when we came down from the church. We decided to eat. It was the only meal we had in a restaurant. We were not full at all. I really felt that the price of Switzerland was higher than SG.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janicesg/blogPicBed/master/img/receipt.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After the doctoral friend had a football match, we separated. I took the package with CM to catch the train and returned to the base in Basel. I will stay here for the next few days. But there was no Wi-Fi on the first night, we went downstairs to the Wi-Fi of the supermarket and contacted the landlord. The landlord was on vacation abroad, saying that there was a technical problem with an operator, and it would be fixed the next day, so we two You can only take a bath early to rest and recuperate for tomorrow’s travel.</p>

<p>PS: Google translator is so funny. Look at this line “I painted a special painting in the toilet”, actually I meant “I put up a light make-up in the restroom”. Still a long way to go! </p>
